# Stray-Birds

### 1
Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away. <br />And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sigh. <br />夏鸟临窗犹可歌<br />秋叶辞树徒长叹

O Troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints in my words.<br />天地远行客<br />戚戚入我诗

### 3
The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.<br />It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.

Once we dreamt that we weres trangers.<br />We wake up to find that we were dear to each other.<br />梦中各分散<br />醒时同交欢
